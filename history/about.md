I am a Computer Science and Statistics double major at Mount Holyoke College. My work lies in the intersection between full-stack software development and applications of AI/ML. Outside of school/professional stuff, I am a full-time matcha enthusiast, and a part-time [graphic designer](https://www.behance.net/dolinh).

- Now...

I started off the last summer of college as a SDE intern @ Amazon, in the Expansions Growth and Tech Division. A recurring bottleneck for setting up services in new marketplaces was the manual effort to copy-and-paste configurations. My project was an AI-powered solution aiming to address that by automating these procedures using AI. 

I was responsible for building the engine that will parse user requests and automate the given procedures using internal LLMs. From it, I learned more about prompt engineering, thread/concurrency, and AWS services (SQS/DLQ, S3 Bucket, SecretsManager, SNS, API Gateway), and applied them in real-world contexts. 

- In junior year...

In the fall, I collaborated to build a [full-stack Rails bike rental application](/projects/valetbike). I was involved in wireframing/prototyping, front-end, back-end development using RESTful APIs, and payment processing using Stripe APIs. During the semester, I also continued my work from the summer to develop interactive apps with computer vision technologies. 

- In sophomore year...

I worked as a computer systems researcher @ Brown University during the Spring. My project is a [data-driven question and answer web application](/projects/question-and-answer), which uses K-Means clustering to simplify the grading assignment process for teaching assistants/professors. 

During the summer, I did my internship @ VNEXT Software. I was responsible for refactoring a human resources management app into different microservices using Odoo framework. The experience further honed my skills in microservices development, Agile methodology, and collaborative coding. Alongside internship, I also [did an independent research](/projects/gesture-verse) on developing interactive software using MediaPipe for hand detection and gesture recognition. 

- In freshman summer...

I completed my internship @ CMC Corporation, where I worked on researching and training object detection models for the document analysis task. My work focused on generating robust data for training, and evaluating the model performance for enhancement.
