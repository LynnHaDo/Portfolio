# Description

Trained a deep learning document layout detection model that led to improved detection accuracy in post-training analysis and fine-tuning results of form analysis task. 

Leveraged state-of-the-art detection networks to detect 11 classes in a document (Title, Table, List, Figure, Text, etc.) with approx. 0.8 mean Average Precision at 0.5 IOU for all classes with a small dataset.
