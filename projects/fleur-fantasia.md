Fleur Fantasia is a full-stack e-commerce web app that allows users to browse and purchase different flower/plant options. As a solo effort, this project gave me full-stack ownership, from prototyping, system design to the actual deployment. I was familiar with Angular, and so it was an easy choice for me. For the server side, I noticed that Spring Boot can greatly streamline a lot of database manipulation steps, which is great for building RESTful APIs. 

This is my first ever full-stack application development projectâ€”there are definitely a lot of things that can be improved. However, through this project, I learned a lot about server-client communication, building efficient RESTful APIs, authorization/authentication process, what data latency even is. As I also deployed the app to AWS (but currently taken down due to service cost (sad)), I learned about how I can deploy each part of the app individually, and set up so that they can successfully communicate. 

# Demo

Like other common e-commerce applications, it supports filtering items, adding items to cart, checking out, user registration, etc with secure HTTPS communication.

The app also supports credit card payment processing using Stripe API, and an integrated log-in/out system with the help of Okta's Auth0. For this, I needed to set up the security chain in Spring Boot for any request attempts. This was also my first time learning about tokens stuff.

# What I did

I developed and designed the app using Angular for the client, Spring Boot for the server, and MySQL databases for database management. After that, I integrated Auth0 for user registration and authentication with fully secured HTTPS communication, and Stripe API into the payment process.
